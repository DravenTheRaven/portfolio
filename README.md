# portfolio
This is the first multi-page project I have done.
It's still a bit of a mess.
I need to figure out how to add images to git hub.
I also have yet to put any media tags in the css.
One of the goals was to get the sticky browser to work right.
Check.
I am going to change the photo carosel to javascript instead of css.
The backgrounds of the actual portfolio pages need changing.
I need to make the contact form actually work.
I need to clean up the nav bar on most pages.
I need to actually add something to the about page.
